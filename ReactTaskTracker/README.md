# Task Tracker in React

- This was created in react following along with Brad Traversy's crash course
- Notable deviations
    - I am not using his css
    - Instead it's written with Bootstrap 5 
    - I am not using the react-icons either. This project uses line-awesome
    - There are some additional effects mostly because I wanted to see if they would work or not
    - I am using the uuid package instead of generating the pseudo random ID. Again, mostly to see if it would work. 
    - I installed react-dotenv to use environment variables.
